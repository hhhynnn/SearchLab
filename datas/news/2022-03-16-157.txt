The Russian authorities have been threatening to ban platforms such as Facebook and Instagram for a long time.\\nBut declaring a major tech company an \\\"extremist organisation\\\" is a drastic move, even by Russian standards.\\nMany ordinary Russians are unlikely to feel the implications of today's announcement straight away. \\nAfter all, access to Facebook and Instagram has already been restricted in the country over what Moscow sees as \\\"fake news\\\" about its invasion of Ukraine.\\nBut the long-term implications of this are significant.\\nInstagram is extremely popular in Russia and - as some experts point out - crucial to small businesses as well as lifestyle bloggers.\\nBesides, not many Russians know how to use a VPN, which means potentially huge swaths of the population could be cut off from some of the major Western social media platforms.\\nThere is also the issue of WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta and is the most popular messenger in Russia.\\nSo far, indications in the Russian media suggest that it may be spared.\\nMeta announced it had changed its policy after the Reuters news agency said it had seen internal emails outlining the policy shift.\\n\\\"In light of the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, we made a temporary exception for those affected by the war, to express violent sentiments toward invading armed forces,\\\" a Meta spokesperson told the BBC.\\nUnder the amended policy, users in countries including Russia, Ukraine and Poland will also be able to call for the deaths of Mr Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.\\nThe emails reportedly said calls for the leaders' deaths will be allowed unless they contain other targets, or included a location or methods.\\nCalls for violence against Russians are also allowed when the post clearly references the invasion of Ukraine, the emails reportedly said.\\n\\\"We demand that US authorities stop the extremist activities of Meta, take measures to bring the perpetrators to justice,\\\" Russia's embassy in the US tweeted.\\n\\\"Users of Facebook and Instagram did not give the owners of these platforms the right to determine the criteria of truth and pit nations against each other,\\\" it added.\\nRussia announced last week that it was blocking Facebook and its platforms, citing 26 cases of \\\"discrimination\\\" against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020.\\nWhile access to the site had already been restricted in Russia, it was not completely unavailable.\\nMoscow has cracked down on several social media platforms as it pursues what it calls a \\\"special operation\\\" in Ukraine.\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60709208\"}"
