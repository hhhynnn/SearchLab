I know I'll never take another shot like that again. \\n\\\"It's a real one-in-a-million stuff.\\\"\\nMr Swan, whose mother booked the stargazing session for the family as a Christmas present, said they would be getting the photo printed, framed and on the wall this week.\\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
