I am an elderly woman\\\", one of those targeted wrote in a complaint.\\nAnother person wrote that their mother-in-law had received a cold call designed \\\"to persuade an elderly vulnerable person with old age memory loss to take out unneeded insurance on equipment\\\".\\nThe mother-in-law \\\"is unable to arrange her own affairs\\\" the complainant reported.\\nThe data privacy watchdog said companies were deliberately targeting older people when buying marketing data lists from third parties.\\nThe companies were specifically asking for personal information about people who are aged 60 and over, homeowners and with landline numbers, the ICO said.\\nThe evidence gathered by the ICO led it to believe the companies were either working together or using the same marketing list to target people. \\nAs a result some lost thousands of pounds on white goods insurance and servicing which the companies often knew they did not need, it said. \\nJohn Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, wrote in a statement: \\\"These are unlawful predatory marketing calls that were targeted at some of the most vulnerable members of our society and driven purely by financial gain\\\".\\nMr Edwards warned companies employing these tactics to expect a strong response and encouraged anyone pestered by such calls to report their concerns to the ICO.\\nThe consumer organisation Which? welcomed the fines saying over the years it had reported over 100 firms that were cold-calling people about insurance for white goods or other household appliances to the ICO and Trading Standards.\\nJenny Ross, Which?
