I think I was like 20, and I ain't know everything that was in my contract.\\\"\\nIt has since been dropped, and the label allowed her to release music. \\n1501 boss, Carl Crawford, posted on Instagram on Tuesday referencing the resolved lawsuit from 2020. \\nMegan shared a screenshot of his post to her Instagram - which she has since deleted. She said Crawford \\\"never know [what] is going on with business.\\\"\\n\\\"We are most definitely STILL IN COURT and YOU STILL GETTING SUED BC YOU OWE ME MONEY!\\n\\\"I AINT NEVER BEEN PAID FROM 1501 IN MY LIFE!\\\"\\nThe new lawsuit isn't seeking payment from 1501, except legal fees, only recognition that Something for Thee Hotties is an album.\\nIn the lawsuit filed by Megan's lawyers, it says: \\\"'Something for Thee Hotties' clearly meets the definition of 'Album' under the recording agreement because it is not less than forty-five (45) minutes in length.\\\"\\nAccording to the lawyers, a length of 45 minutes or more is the only requirement in Megan's contract to define what constitutes an album. \\nThe lawsuit says: \\\"1501's new position, taken months after the album's release, is clearly a ruse in an effort to try to take further advantage of [Megan], at great expense and not in good faith.\\\"\\nIn the 2021 Grammy's, Megan took home Best New Artist, and, along with Beyonc\\u00c3\\u00a9, won Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song for \\\"Savage (Remix).\\nNewsbeat has contacted Megan Thee Stallion's management, and 1501, for comment, but neither has responded.\\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here. \", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-60492452\"}"
