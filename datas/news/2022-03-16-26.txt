"{\"title\": \"What is fracking and why is it controversial?\", \"rtime\": \"2022-03-15\", \"content\": \"Drilling companies suggest 50 years' worth of shale gas could be extracted from underneath the UK through a process known as \\\"fracking\\\". Industry bodies and geologists think it's just a tenth of that.\\nHydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique for recovering gas and oil from shale rock.\\nIn November 2019, the government ended its support for fracking citing risks from earth tremors. Some have been urging it to rethink that decision - given Europe's reliance on Russian energy -  but how does fracking work and why is it controversial?\\nFracking is the process of drilling into the earth and directing a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals at a rock layer in order to release the gas inside.\\nThe wells can be drilled vertically or horizontally in order to release the gas. The term fracking refers to how the rock is fractured apart by the high-pressure mixture.\\nFracking for shale gas in the UK has been sporadic and has faced public and legal challenges. In 2019, it was indefinitely suspended following an inconclusive report by the Oil and Gas Authority into earth tremors.\\nExploration during that period identified large swathes of shale gas across the UK, particularly in northern England.\\nMore than 100 exploration and drilling licences were awarded to firms including Third Energy, IGas, Aurora Energy Resources and Ineos.\\nBut Cuadrilla was the only one given consent to begin fracking. \\nIt drilled two wells at a site in Lancashire but faced repeated protests on climate and safety grounds, from local people and campaigners. The Oil and Gas Authority has told Cuadrilla to permanently concrete and abandon the wells by the end of June 2022.\\nGovernments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have continued to oppose fracking pending further research into its environmental impact.\\nCurrently the UK can only meet 48% of its gas demand from domestic supplies (this would be 54% if it did not export any gas). \\nThis has followed a sustained reduction in UK gas production as existing gas fields are depleted.\\nA small number of Tory MPs, known as the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, have urged the government to end its fracking ban. They claim drilling at Cuadrilla's two existing wells could be quickly restarted and would provide significant supplies. \\nCuadrilla itself has claimed that \\\"just 10%\\\" of the gas from shale deposits in Lancashire and surrounding areas \\\"could supply 50 years' worth of current UK gas demand\\\".\\nBut energy experts dispute this. Mike Bradshaw, professor of global energy at Warwick University, says estimates of how much shale gas the UK has are not the same as the amount of gas that could be produced commercially.\\nOpponents of fracking point out that even if the ban were reversed, it would take many years for the wells to start producing gas commercially.\\nThe injection of fluid at high pressure into the rock can cause earth tremors - small movements in the earth's surface. More than 120 tremors were recorded during drilling at Cuadrilla's New Preston Road site.\\nSeismic events of this scale are considered minor and are rarely felt by people - but are a concern to local residents. \\nFracking also uses huge amounts of water, which must be transported to the site at significant environmental cost.\\nCampaigners say fracking is distracting energy firms and governments from investing in renewable sources of energy, and encourages continued reliance on fossil fuels.\\n\\\"Shale gas is not the solution to the UK's energy challenges,\\\" said Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Tony Bosworth.\\nWhat are the government's plans?\\nThe UK government has said fracking will remain banned unless the science or the public position on it changes.\\nHowever, No 10 has refused to rule out lifting the government's moratorium on fracking, saying \\\"all options\\\" would be considered as it considered how to end UK imports of Russian energy.\\nIn its new energy plan released in March, Labour reiterated its position that fracking should not be restarted.\\nIt is estimated to have given energy security to the US and Canada for the next 100 years, and has presented an opportunity to generate electricity at half the CO2 emissions of coal.\\nHowever, the UK's shale gas reserves are in geologically complex rock layers. Iain Conn, the former chief executive of energy firm Centrica, told the BBC: \\\"It's much more difficult to develop shale in the UK than the US... and the quality of our shale is not as good.\\\"\\nFracking remains banned in numerous EU countries, including Germany, France and Spain, as well as Australia. Others, such as Brazil and Argentina are split, with some local authorities banning it and others continuing operations.\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-14432401\"}"
