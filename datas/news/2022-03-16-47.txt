You know, we've had many ups over the last six years and been told she's been about to be released. So there's an element of false hopes and I think our family, Nazanin, her parents, find it hard to get too excited at the moment,\\\" she said.\\n\\\"Since Sunday, neither Nazanin nor her parents can settle. I think there's a lot of twitching going on in that flat, a sort of high tension and just waiting to see what happens.\\\"\\nFor more on Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's story you can listen to Radio 4's Nazanin series on BBC Sounds.\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60762226\"}"
