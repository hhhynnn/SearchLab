It's just time away from the monotony of sitting in bed.\\\"\\nThe MacGregor Children's Ward had admitted a rising number of teenagers who had mental health issues, particularly girls, she added.\\nShe believes some young people had \\\"struggled to cope\\\" during the pandemic and being away from friends or found it hard to deal with problems. \\nRecent reports nationally have found steep increases in the number of children referred for specialist mental health care in 2021, including for conditions such as anxiety and depression. \\nThe appeal by South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust's charitable fund aims to give staff the \\\"tools and resources\\\" to support these patients. \\nMoney will also be spent on updating the ward's furnishings and creating a quiet room for parents and carers. \\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
