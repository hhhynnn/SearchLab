"{\"title\": \"When will free Covid tests end across the UK?\", \"rtime\": \"2022-03-15\", \"content\": \"Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has set out how Covid testing will work in Scotland after changes in England.\\nUnder the government's \\\"Living with Covid\\\" plan, most people in England will no longer get free PCR or Lateral flow tests (LFTs) after 1 April.\\nScotland will still offer some free tests until the end of April, while Wales has confirmed it will offer some free tests until July. \\nNicola Sturgeon said that some free testing will be available until the end of April, but the rules about who needs to test and when will change. \\nFrom 18 April:\\nUntil 30 April: \\nFrom 1 May: \\nScottish government: Update on changes to the Covid regulations\\nFree lateral flow tests (LFTs) won't be available after 1 April, except for the over-75s and over-12s with weakened immune systems.\\nEveryone else will have to buy tests. \\nBoots has already started selling single LFTs online for \\u00c2\\u00a35.99, or four for \\u00c2\\u00a317. \\nThe number of free NHS tests distributed each day in England has been capped \\\"to manage demand\\\". \\nPeople without symptoms can now only order one pack of seven LFTs every three days - previously it was one per day. \\nFree PCR tests won't be available to people with Covid symptoms from April either, except for a small number of at-risk groups, with details to be announced.\\nFree testing will remain for social care workers with Covid symptoms and NHS staff but these may not be funded separately. \\nWales has said it will maintain some testing capacity until the end of June:\\nAfter then, free LFTs won't be available, contact tracing and self-isolation support payments will end, and self-isolation guidance will be updated to advise ill people to stay at home if possible. \\nNorthern Ireland hasn't confirmed its plans.\\nAcross the UK, anyone without Covid symptoms can order one box of LFTs every three days using their NHS login.\\nYou can also collect LFTs from pharmacies, vaccination hubs and test centres, but should register online to get a \\\"collection code\\\" first. \\nYou should report all LFT results online, or by calling 119.\\nPeople with symptoms can order a home PCR test kit, or book an appointment at a test site.\\nPeople in England don't need to self-isolate or take daily tests after contact with someone with Covid, even if they aren't fully vaccinated. Routine contact tracing has also ended. \\nAcross the rest of the UK, if you are fully vaccinated (two doses - three in Scotland), you don't have to self-isolate, but should take daily LFTs for seven days (or for 10 days after your last contact, if this is earlier). \\nIf any of the LFTs are positive, you must self-isolate from the date of the test. \\nFully vaccinated close contacts in Scotland will no longer have to do daily LFTs after 30 April. \\nClose contacts of positive cases who are not fully vaccinated still have to self-isolate for the full 10 days. \\nIn Wales, unvaccinated contacts are advised to take LFTs on days two and eight, even if they have no symptoms. Anyone who develops symptoms should take a PCR test. \\nStaff and students in most education and childcare settings in England no longer have to test twice-weekly. Arrangements for NHS staff will be confirmed in March.\\nIn the rest of the UK, NHS and education staff are still asked to test twice a week. Secondary pupils should test twice a week during term time (three times a week in Wales). \\nScotland recommends that everyone should still test at least twice a week, especially before going to a crowded place or mixing with someone who is vulnerable.\\nYou may need to still test before or after travelling abroad. You must buy private tests for this - you cannot use free NHS tests.  \\nLFTs and PCR tests do different things:\\nBoth tests involve swabbing your nose and/or throat. LFTs can be done at home, and show results in 20 to 30 minutes. \\nPCR test swabs must be sent to a lab for analysis, with results provided in 24 to 48 hours, although it can take longer to confirm a particular variant.\\nBeing vaccinated against Covid cannot cause you to test positive on either an LFT or PCR test.\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51943612\"}"
