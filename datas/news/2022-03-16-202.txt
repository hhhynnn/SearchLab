"{\"title\": \"Ukraine conflict: What is Nato and how has it responded to Russia's invasion?\", \"rtime\": \"2022-03-16\", \"content\": \"Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged that his country cannot join Nato in the near future - despite its long-standing hope to do so.\\nNato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said the security bloc remained united in its support of Ukraine. Member states including Britain are already sending weapons to help it fight the Russian invasion\\nHowever, the alliance has rejected calls to enforce a \\\"no-fly zone\\\", saying it could lead to direct conflict with Russia. \\nRussia has put its nuclear forces on \\\"special alert\\\" to counter what it calls Nato's aggression.\\nNato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - is a military alliance formed in 1949 by 12 countries, including the US, Canada, the UK and France.\\nMembers agree to come to one another's aid in the event of an armed attack against any one member state.\\nIts aim was originally to counter the threat of post-war Russian expansion in Europe. \\nIn 1955 Soviet Russia responded to Nato by creating its own military alliance of eastern European communist countries, called the Warsaw Pact.\\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, a number of former Warsaw Pact countries switched sides and became Nato members. The alliance now has 30 members.\\nNato originally offered Ukraine eventual membership back in 2008, and after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukraine made joining Nato a priority.\\nBut this hasn't happened, mainly because of Russia's long-standing opposition to such a move. \\nRussia fears Nato is encroaching on its territory by taking on new members in eastern Europe, and that admitting Ukraine would bring Nato forces into its backyard.\\nUkraine's President Zelensky has now accepted his country cannot join Nato at present, saying: \\\"It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of Nato. We understand this.\\\"\\nThe UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson made the same point, saying, \\\"There is no way Ukraine is going to join Nato any time soon\\\".\\nOne of Russia's demands before the invasion was that Ukraine should never be allowed to join - something the alliance had refused to support.\\nUkraine is not a member of Nato, so the alliance is not obliged to come to the country's defence.\\nNato countries have also made it plain that if their troops were to confront Russian forces in Ukraine, it could lead to an all-out conflict between Russia and the west. \\nNato has rejected imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, to deny Russia air superiority and protect civilians.\\nIt wants to avoid conflict between Russian and its air forces. \\nNato planes might need to fire anti-radiation missiles (ARMs) at radar installations on Russian territory.\\nRussia could use this as a reason to declare war on Nato countries.\\nSeveral Nato nations have been sending weapons to Ukraine to help its defend itself against Russia. \\nThe US initially sent weapons $200m (\\u00c2\\u00a3149m) to Ukraine, including Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, and allowed other Nato countries to supply Ukraine with US-made weapons.  It is no sending an extra $350m (\\u00c2\\u00a3261m) in weapons including anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft systems and body armour.\\nThe EU has said it will spend up to 450m euros (\\u00c2\\u00a3376m) to fund the supply of weapons to Ukraine. It's the first time in its history the EU has helped provide arms for a warzone.\\nSweden is sending 5,000 anti-tank weapons, helmets, body armour and rations. \\nBritain has sent 2,000 anti-tank missiles and says it will send more weapons in the future.\\nGermany is sending 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles. It has also dropped some restrictions on other countries sending German-made weapons to Ukraine. \\nThe Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have also sent weapons and other supplies.\\nHow many troops does Nato have in Eastern Europe?\\nNato already has troops stretching from the Baltic republics in the north to Romania in the south and now deploying more forces. \\nThey were stationed there in 2014 after Russia's annexation of Crimea and are designed to act as a \\\"tripwire\\\" in case of a Russian attack.\\nNato is now sending elements of its 40,000-strong Response Force to Eastern European countries bordering Russia and Ukraine. \\nIt has 100 fighter jets on high alert and 120 ships, including three carrier groups, patrolling the seas from the far north to the eastern Mediterranean. \\n\\\"We will defend every ally and every inch of Nato territory,\\\" said alliance secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg\\nPresident Putin of Russia has put the country's nuclear forces onto \\\"special alert\\\" because of \\\"aggressive statements\\\" by the West.\\nThe announcement does not mean Russia intends to use the weapons.\\nThe US has committed to sending more troops to Europe, but President Biden said they will not be fighting in Ukraine itself.\\nThe extra troops will join the four multinational battlegroups Nato has in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, and its multinational brigade in Romania.\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18023383\"}"
