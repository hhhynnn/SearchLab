These cases have not yet come to court.\\nAlan Tribe, the Met's director of forensic operations, said scientists had been looking for bloodstains since about 1813 but identifying blood on dark clothing had been an ever-increasing challenge.\\nHe said: \\\"We know that the dynamics of some violent offences in London are that we see stabbings in the street and we would look for the transfer of bloodstains between items of clothing.\\n\\\"It's pretty routine for us to see black t-shirts, dark vests, dark puffer jackets, dark hoodies appearing as items that we need to search for blood.\\\"\\nHowever, the traditional method of using a microscope was not completely defunct, the force added, as some fabric dyes will not reflect the infrared light.\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-60763434\"}"
