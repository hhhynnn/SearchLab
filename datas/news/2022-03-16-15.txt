The family requests privacy at this time.\\\"\\nVariety said the news was confirmed by Hurt's friend Gerry Byrne.\\nFellow Marvel actor Mark Ruffalo wrote on Twitter: \\\"Wow, another Major loss to the acting community. Great actor. Great mind. RIP.\\\"\\nMatthew Modine described him as \\\"a consummate professional\\\" who was \\\"continually searching for greater truth and human understanding\\\".\\nAntonio Banderas said \\\"a great actor has left us\\\", while other tributes came from Russell Crowe, M Night Shyamalan Rebecca Front.\\nHurt began acting on stage in the 1970s before making his big-screen breakthrough as an obsessed scientist in Altered States, which earned him a best newcomer nomination at the Golden Globes in 1981. \\nThat year, he also starred as a womanising lawyer in erotic thriller Body Heat, before being cast in The Big Chill and Gorky Park.\\nWinning an Oscar for playing a gay man who shares a cell with a political prisoner in Kiss of the Spider Woman was \\\"very isolating\\\",he later told the Los Angeles Times.\\n\\\"The instant they gave it to me, I thought, God, what do I do now?
