It means that Foxconn employees working in the space cannot move outside the group.\\nFoxconn said: \\\"This process, which can only be done on campuses that include both employee housing and production facilities, adheres to strict industry guidelines and closed-loop management policies issued by the Shenzhen government.\\\"\\nThere are concerns the restrictions could have an impact on global supply chains.\\nBut Yum China's chief executive Joey Wat, said: \\\"Our robust supply chain management has shielded us from material business disruptions.\\\" \\nYum China said it had more than doubled the number of stores it had closed or restricted to take-out services from 500 in January to 1,100 in March.\\nMr Wat pledged: \\\"We will keep our restaurants open and provide food services to customers wherever it is possible and safe to do so.\\\" \\nRestaurateur Birol Dincli, who owns three steakhouses in Shenzhen's Futian district, expects the situation to be even worse this time around compared to when the Covid pandemic began in 2020.\\nAll restaurants in the Futian business district have been ordered to close.

He has asked some of his 30 employees to return to their hometowns to wait out the surge. \\n\\\"In 2020, we faced the same problem so they are understanding. We motivate them to just wait and (be on) standby,\\\" he said. \\n\\\"Let's see what will happen and then we will keep going.\\\"\\nAll 24 million residents of the north-eastern Jilin province were placed under quarantine orders on Monday. People are banned from moving around and anyone wanting to leave the province must apply for police permission.\\nIn the Jilin city of Changchun, residents must stay at home. Only one person from each household is allowed to leave to buy food and other necessities every two days.   \\nSome 12.5 million people living in Shenzhen - dubbed China's Silicon Valley - are also living under a five-day lockdown.\\nBusinesses in many of the affected regions have closed or are having their employees work from home.\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60760556\"}"
