"{\"title\": \"Robot arms to help perform cancer operations in Wales\", \"rtime\": \"2022-03-14\", \"content\": \"Thousands of cancer patients across Wales could soon be operated on by robotic arms controlled by surgeons.\\nPreviously, patients living in north Wales had to travel to England for robot-assisted surgery.\\nFrom June, the arms will be used to perform some surgeries at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor.\\nDoctors said the technology would improve accuracy and help patients recover more quickly.\\nThe first machine at the hospital comes as part of plans to establish an \\\"all-Wales robotic assisted surgery network\\\", with more of the technology expected to be rolled out across the country. \\nThe robotic arms will be used by the NHS to perform procedures for some prostate and gynaecological cancers, and some procedures on the digestive system, kidneys and bladder.\\nThe jointed arms with surgical instruments at the end are used to perform keyhole surgery, and are moved by a surgeon who controls them via a computer.\\nCameras on the arms let the surgeons see what is happening, and they can zoom in and magnify the area being operated on.\\nConsultant Urologist Mohamed Abdulmajed, who was one of the first medics to be trained using the robot at Ysbyty Gwynedd, said there were many benefits to using the technology.\\n\\\"One of the first operations we'll be doing with the robotic arms is men's prostate cancer surgery,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"We can be sure of a high level of accuracy, and avoid the nerves which control a man's sexual function, and reduce the risk of someone being made incontinent by the surgery.\\n\\\"Overall, keyhole surgery with a robotic arm has many advantages for patients compared to open surgery.\\n\\\"The wounds are smaller, there's less blood loss, and that in turn means a shorter hospital stay and an earlier recovery, allowing a person to return to work sooner.\\\"\\nBut he reassured patients that while the technology was being used, the operation was still being carried out by a surgeon, who is in control and makes the decisions.\\nA second robot is set to be placed at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board - adding to a similar one already at the health board - which has been used for surgery on hard to reach head and neck cancers.\\nThe Welsh government said other health boards across Wales were expected to follow, which would provide less invasive surgery for thousands of cancer patients across the country.\\nNHS Wales managers said this area of technology was developing fast.\\nThey will be working with medical technology company, CMR Surgical, which builds the robot arms, to do further research into how they can be used in the future.\\nJared Torkington, who is heading up Wales' robotic surgery programme, believes the next 20 years will see more radical change.\\n\\\"We can look forward to a future where healthcare is even less invasive and better able to fit the individual needs of patients,\\\" he said.\\nNHS managers also hope having the latest technology in north Wales' hospitals will help them attract and retain staff.\\nThe Welsh government has committed \\u00c2\\u00a34.2m to developing robot-assisted surgery in Wales over five years, with health boards also providing more than \\u00c2\\u00a313m over 10 years towards the programme.\\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan said: \\\"It will put Wales at the forefront of international research for the use of robotic surgical techniques.\\n\\\"This pioneering service will also encourage specialist staff to come to Wales to train and practise,\\\" she said.\\n\\\"Once the programme is fully established in the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board area, patients in north Wales will no longer need to travel to England to receive robotic-assisted surgery.\\\"\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-60721967\"}"
