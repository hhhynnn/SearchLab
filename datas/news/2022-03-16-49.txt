This recommends that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.\\nThe requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings - like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties - was also reduced from 2m to 1m from 31 January.\\nThe vaccine passport scheme - which covers nightclubs and large events - ended on Monday 28 February.\\nHowever, the app will remain operational for any business which wants to keep using it.\\nPeople who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests.\\nThe first of these tests must be taken on the sixth day after testing positive and then at least 24 hours later.\\nIn addition, household contacts of people with the virus can take a lateral flow test every day for seven days rather than going into self-isolation.\\nThis applies to everyone in the household under the age of 18 or anyone over that age who has had the first, second and booster Covid jabs. \\nIf one of these tests is positive, self-isolation will then be required for that person.\\nAnyone identified as a close contact who is aged over 18 and four months and not fully vaccinated will still be asked to self-isolate for 10 days and take a PCR test.\\nFor those with symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test.\\nPeople returning a positive lateral flow test who have no symptoms are no longer required to take a PCR test to confirm the result. Instead, they will be asked to isolate immediately and report their result online.\\nPeople are advised to take a lateral flow test at least twice a week - especially if they are going to a crowded place or mixing with someone who is clinically vulnerable.\\nHowever, that advice will end on 18 April, and people will no longer be asked to test regularly in workplaces, early learning and childcare settings, mainstream and special schools, and universities and colleges.\\nClose contacts of positive cases will continue to be advised to take lateral flow tests for seven days until the end of April, and those with symptoms will still be urged to get a PCR test. Contact tracing of positive cases will also continue until the end of April.\\nHowever, it is expected that all routine population-wide testing will stop at the end of April, including for those who have Covid symptoms. Contact tracing will end at the same time.\\nSecondary school pupils in Scotland have not been required to wear face coverings in classrooms since 28 February, although they will still be required in communal areas and when moving around school buildings.\\nWhole classes no longer need to self-isolate when a pupil tests positive, with only the closest contacts of positive cases required to test and isolate.\\nCarbon dioxide monitors - which assess how well-ventilated a space is - are also required in schools and childcare settings.\\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has announced an end to all remaining Covid restrictions in England, to be replaced by a \\\"Living with Covid\\\" plan.\\nPeople with Covid are no longer legally required to self-isolate, although there will be guidance that those who test positive should stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days.\\nRoutine contact tracing will end and workers will no longer be required to tell their employer if they need to self-isolate.\\nCovid tests will no longer be free for most people from 1 April, and the use of Covid passports will no longer be recommended, except for international travel.\\nWales expects to scrap all remaining Covid restrictions from 28 March, but will maintain some testing measures until July. \\nLegal measures have been replaced by guidance in Northern Ireland, which recommends that face masks are still worn in certain places, such as enclosed public spaces and health and social care settings.\\nDo you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?
