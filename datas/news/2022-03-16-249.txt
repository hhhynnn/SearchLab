"{\"title\": \"What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing?\", \"rtime\": \"2021-11-04\", \"content\": \"Countries have set out plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow.\\nThey hope to achieve the target of \\\"net zero\\\" by 2050, to help slow global warming.\\nNet zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \\nAchieving it means reducing emissions as much as possible, as well as balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount.\\nGreenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) are released when we burn oil, gas and coal for our homes, factories and transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill. These gases cause global warming by trapping the sun's energy.\\nMeanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees and plants to absorb CO2.\\nUnder the 2015 Paris Agreement, 197 countries agreed to try to keep temperature rises \\\"well below\\\" 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. \\nExperts say that to achieve this, net zero must be reached by 2050. \\nNot all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain have to be compensated for, or offset - for example, by planting more trees.\\nAlmost every country has embarked on tree planting as a cheap way of reducing carbon, although there may not be enough space for the number required.\\nCarbon capture and storage has also been suggested as another solution. \\nThis involves using machinery to remove carbon from the air, then solidifying it and burying it underground.\\nHowever, the technology is still emerging, very expensive and as yet unproven.\\nIt won't be easy. \\nReaching net zero will involve moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy for our power, and abandoning vehicles run on petrol and diesel, in favour of those powered by electricity and hydrogen.\\nGas central heating will need to be replaced by alternative sources, such as heat pumps. \\nReaching net zero could also mean flying far less in future, and eating less red meat.\\nPresenting the government's net zero strategy to the House of Commons in the run up to COP26, the government pledged:\\nThe government had already announced a ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, and that all the UK's electricity will come from renewable sources by 2035.\\nAt the time, Shadow Business Secretary Ed Miliband called the latest announcements \\\"a massive let-down\\\".\\nMore than 130 countries have pledged to reach net zero emissions before 2050.\\nHowever, China - currently the biggest producer of CO2 in the world - says it's aiming for \\\"carbon neutrality\\\" by 2060. It hasn't set out exactly what this means or how it will get there. \\nRussia - the third-largest producer of oil worldwide - has also pledged to reach net zero by 2060, although its draft commitment hasn't been legally ratified. \\nUntil recently President Putin dismissed the risks posed by rising temperatures.\\nUS President Joe Biden criticised the Russian and Chinese leaders for not attending the COP26 summit. \\nIndia - the world's fourth biggest emitter of CO2 after China, the US and the EU - has promised to cut its emissions to net zero by 2070. \\nSome of the world's most heavily populated countries - including Indonesia - haven't made any net zero commitment.\\nBut many of the announcements which have already come out of the COP26 summit on deforestation, cutting methane and reducing coal are directly linked to helping countries hit their net zero goal.\\nThere's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.\\nFor instance, Country A might record lower emissions if it shuts down energy-intensive industries such as steel production. \\nBut if Country A then imports steel from Country B, it's effectively handed on its carbon emissions to Country B instead of reducing the sum total of greenhouse gases.\\nThere are schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels. \\nHowever, some climate scientists worry such arrangements could let wealthier nations avoid reducing their own fossil fuel usage. \\nAnd it's hard to say that initiatives funded to offset emissions elsewhere would not have happened anyway.\\nThe COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58874518\"}"
