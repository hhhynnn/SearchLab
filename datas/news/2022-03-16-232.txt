"{\"title\": \"COP26: What was agreed at the Glasgow climate conference?\", \"rtime\": \"2021-11-15\", \"content\": \"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit.\\nIt aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough.\\nThe agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade:\\nEmissions\\nIt was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a greenhouse gas which causes climate change.\\nThis is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a \\\"climate catastrophe\\\". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. \\nCoal\\nFor the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions.  \\nHowever, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to \\\"phase down\\\" rather than \\\"phase out\\\" coal after a late intervention by China and India. \\nDeveloping countries\\nThe agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy.\\nThere's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (\\u00c2\\u00a372bn) a year by 2020 was missed.\\nWhile some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the \\\"start of a breakthrough\\\", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. \\nFossil fuel subsidies\\nWorld leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas.\\nHowever, no firm dates have been set.\\nA flurry of other announcements were made:\\nThe world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China, pledged to cooperate more over the next decade in areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy.\\nChina has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. \\nLeaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests - promised to stop deforestation by 2030.\\nThis is seen as vital, as tress absorb vast amounts of CO2. \\nSimilar initiatives haven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed.\\nA scheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030 was agreed by more than 100 countries. \\nMethane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. \\nThe big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later.\\nFinancial organisations controlling $130tn agreed to back \\\"clean\\\" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries.\\nThe initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets.\\nHowever, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. \\nMost commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed.\\nOnly a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. \\nCOP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015 Paris Agreement. \\nSix years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming \\\"well below\\\" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C.\\nCOP stands for \\\"Conference of the Parties\\\", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. \\nThe goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reach net zero by mid-century.\\nNext year's COP27 summit is in Egypt.\\nTop image from Getty Images.
