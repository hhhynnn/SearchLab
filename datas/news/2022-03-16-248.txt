"{\"title\": \"Covid in Scotland: The latest cases\", \"rtime\": \"2022-03-15\", \"content\": \"There have been 1,622,345 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland and 11,016 people have died within 28 days of a positive test, according to the Scottish government.\\nFrom 1 March 2022 the figures include people who have been reinfected with Covid at least 90 days after an initial positive test.\\nThis page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and was last updated using figures available from 14:00 on 15 March.\\nDue to technical issues Public Health Scotland was unable to provide new figures for 12 - 14 March. The data published on 15 March covers data since Saturday 12 March.\\nOver the past seven days 78,334 cases have been reported, with 38,770 cases confirmed on Wednesday. This includes cases reported since Saturday. \\nThese totals include PCR tests and positive lateral flow tests, following changes on 6 January to how Covid infections are detected.\\nThe next chart shows the number of positive results over the past 12 months by the date of the test.\\nBecause of the time it takes to process the tests and submit records, the most recent figures in this chart are from three days ago.\\nThis chart shows how case rates have been changing in Scotland over the last few weeks.\\nThe total number of positive cases in each local authority is published daily by Public Health Scotland.\\nRecent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded, so this chart also uses figures from five days ago.\\nThe first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020.\\nThe spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid-19.\\nThe rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021.\\nDeaths from Covid continued throughout 2021 and in to 2022. However, the vaccination programme has so far kept the number lower than previous waves, despite the higher number of cases.\\nThe chart below shows data relating to the actual date of death, rather than registration of deaths and the most recent figures are subject to revision.\\nThere are three ways to count deaths from Covid-19.\\nThe Scottish government's daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid-19, whereas the National Records of Scotland (NRS) counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus.\\nThe NRS also publishes data on excess deaths, compared with a five-year average.\\nExcess deaths from most causes rose in 2020 and during 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths. \\nThe first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were administered on 8 December 2020.\\nCurrently the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are being given in Scotland, with each requiring two doses.\\nBooster jabs are being offered to all over-18s.\\nOlder age groups, people with underlying health issues and front-line health and social care workers were prioritised in Scotland's initial vaccination programme, in line with the strategy set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.\\nThe same priorities are being applied to the booster dose programme which began in September.\\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals.\\nAt the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020 there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with over 200 being treated in intensive care.\\nNumbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again last autumn. In January 2021, the number of Covid patients in hospital went over 2,000. They have now almost returned to that level.\\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital, or in the two weeks before their admission, are counted by the Scottish government as Covid-19 patients.\\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test, whichever is later.\\nHowever, the Scottish government also publishes figures on Covid-19 patients who have been treated in intensive care for more than 28 days. \\nThe R number, or reproduction number, is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.\\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially.\\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak. \\nFigures for charts from the Scottish government, Public Health Scotland, National Records of Scotland and the UK government Covid dashboard.\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-53511877\"}"
