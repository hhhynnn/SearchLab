"{\"title\": \"Ukraine war in maps: Tracking the Russian invasion\", \"rtime\": \"2022-03-16\", \"content\": \"Russian advances across Ukraine have slowed in recent days amid mounting casualties, but attempts to encircle and cut off the capital Kyiv continue.\\nHere are the latest developments on day 21 of the invasion: \\nRussia launched its attack in the early hours of 24 February from three main directions: north, south and east.\\nTargets all over the country have been attacked from land, sea and air. \\nRussian forces are attempting to encircle and cut off the Ukrainian capital, with troops gathered at multiple positions around the city.\\nBlasts were heard across Kyiv again on Wednesday morning, with residential areas in the north west of the city hit by Russian shelling. \\nUkrainian generals in the capital have said their focus at the moment is on keeping Russian artillery out of range of the city centre.\\nA 40-mile Russian armoured column to the west of the city has now dispersed, moving more artillery and rocket launchers to within range of the capital's outskirts.\\nFighting on the ground continues in the north west suburbs of Bucha and Irpin, but Russian attempts to cross the Irpin River have failed so far. \\nThat river and others across the city, as well as difficult terrain like marshlands and bogs, have helped Ukrainian forces slow Russian advances so far. \\nThe city is bracing itself for a ground assault but Justin Bronk, a defence analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, told the BBC that he doubts Russia has enough ground forces in place to take the capital at the moment. \\nAlthough Russian troops have pushed forward towards the outskirts of Kyiv, their progress in the north has been slower than in the south.\\nThe main advance towards the capital initially came from Belarus down the west side of the Dnieper River via Chernobyl.\\nRussian forces have faced serious logistical problems, with many vehicles running out of fuel, and have faced strong Ukrainian resistance. \\nIn the north east, Russian troops have surrounded the city of Sumy, bombed vital infrastructure and cut off supply routes. \\nA similar attempt to encircle Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, has been less successful with analysts suggesting Russian forces there have a short supply of ammunition. \\nArtillery attacks on residential areas of Kharkiv are being investigated by United Nations (UN) prosecutors for possible war crimes.\\nRussian forces have made rapid gains across the south of the country, advancing east and west from Crimea.\\nIn the south east, there is growing concern for civilians trapped in the port city of Mariupol, which is encircled by Russian forces and has come under heavy fire.\\nAbout 20,000 residents managed to leave Mariupol, a city of nearly half a million people, on Tuesday, according to the Ukrainian government. \\nSo far, Ukrainian forces have managed to fend off Russian attempts on the ground to capture the city.\\nElsewhere in the south, Russian advances on Mykolaiv in the west have slowed. Taking the city is key for the Russians to push further west towards Odesa. \\nRussian naval forces off the coast of Odesa have conducted some shelling of the city in recent days but an amphibious landing would be very difficult and a sign of Russian desperation, according to Mr Bronk. \\nThe BBC's Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says the port city of Odesa would be a prize for Russia as it would cut off Ukraine's access to the Black Sea.\\nFighting continues in the Donetsk region. Russian forces are reported to be making steady territorial gains in the region.\\nThe Donetsk regional governor said barely anything was left of the city Volnovakha as a result of Russian attacks.\\nIn neighbouring Luhansk, Russian forces are reported to have made several unsuccessful attacks on Severodonetsk.\\nDnipro has come under attack in recent days and is strategically important as a point of convergence for Russian troops coming from the south and east. \\nBy David Brown, Bella Hurrell, Dominic Bailey, Mike Hills, Lucy Rodgers, Paul Sargeant, Mark Bryson, Zoe Bartholomew, Sean Willmott, Sana Dionysiou, Joy Roxas, Gerry Fletcher, Jana Tauschinsk and Prina Shah.\\nTo indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project. \\nFrom 2 March this daily assessment differentiated between \\\"Assessed Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory\\\" and \\\"Assessed Russian advances in Ukraine\\\", the latter indicating areas where Russians are believed to have launched attacks from but which they do not control.  \\nTo show key areas where advances are taking place we are also using daily updates from the UK Ministry of Defence and BBC research. To show locations where there have been attacks or explosions we are using reports that have been verified by the BBC. \\nThe situation in Ukraine is fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps.\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60506682\"}"
