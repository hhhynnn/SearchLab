"{\"title\": \"How much nuclear power does the UK use and is it safe?\", \"rtime\": \"2022-03-15\", \"content\": \"Boris Johnson says it's time to make \\\"big new bets\\\" on nuclear power so the UK's energy can become self-sufficient.\\nThe prime minister said expanding the use of nuclear would help cut bills and resist \\\"bullying\\\" from Russia.\\nHigh energy costs mean households are facing sharp increases to their bills, and sanctions on Russian gas are expected to make things worse.\\nThis is because although the UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia, its prices are affected by fluctuations in the global markets.\\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson said the UK needed a supply that was \\\"more secure, more sustainable and less vulnerable to manipulation by others\\\".\\nLater this month, the government is expected to publish a new strategy setting out how it will use domestic resources rather than rely on energy from other countries.\\nAs well as renewable sources like solar and wind energy, Mr Johnson said this strategy would involve \\\"power that can be relied upon even when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing\\\".\\nAlong with natural gas, nuclear can provide this stable energy supply during times of low output from renewables. \\nAbout 16% of Britain's electricity is provided by nuclear power from 13 reactors, according to the UK government.\\nThe government's plan to reach \\\"net-zero\\\" emissions by 2050 says nuclear power provides a \\\"reliable source of low-carbon electricity\\\". \\nIt has backed the construction of Hinkley C in Somerset, which will be the largest nuclear station in Britain, and there are also proposals for a nuclear plant on the coastline of Suffolk, known as Sizewell C.\\nAs well as larger nuclear power stations, the government is also supporting Small Modular Reactors (SMRs).\\nSMRs work in the same way as conventional nuclear reactors, but on a smaller scale.\\nRolls-Royce, which is receiving more than \\u00c2\\u00a3400m from the government and private investors to develop them, says an SMR would take up the space of roughly two football pitches - a tenth of the size of a conventional nuclear plant -  and would power approximately one million homes.\\nIn mid-2021, 415 civilian nuclear reactors were operating in 33 countries, according to the World Nuclear Industry Status report. \\nTogether, the \\\"big five\\\" - the US, China, France, Russia, and South Korea - generated 72% of all nuclear electricity in the world in 2020. \\nThe industry report says that the nuclear share of the global energy market is steadily declining. \\nBut two countries, Belarus and the United Arab Emirates, started their first reactors last year.\\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, part of the United Nations, says nuclear power plants are among \\\"the safest and most secure facilities in the world\\\".\\nThey are subject to stringent international safety standards. \\nThere was widespread alarm earlier this month when a nuclear power station in Ukraine - the largest in Europe - was hit by shelling before being taken over by Russia.\\nAnd there have been some high-profile accidents, where large amounts of radioactive material were released into the environment.\\nThe worst nuclear accident in history resulted from an explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. A tsunami caused by an enormous earthquake flooded the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan in 2011. \\nEven under normal conditions, generating nuclear power produces hazardous radioactive waste, which needs to be safely managed and stored for hundreds of years. \\nBut a House of Lords paper from October says the issue of nuclear waste remains \\\"unresolved in the UK\\\".\\nIt is currently stored in temporary facilities which are not designed for the permanent storage of so-called \\\"high-level\\\" radioactive waste.\\nThe government's preferred solution is \\\"geological disposal\\\" - placing waste deep in a rock formation that would prevent radioactivity from escaping. \\nHowever, no community has agreed to host such a facility.\\nThe main nuclear fuels are uranium and plutonium. In a nuclear power station, the fuel undergoes a controlled \\\"chain reaction\\\" to produce heat which then drives turbines and generates electricity.\\nUnlike fossil fuels, nuclear power stations don't produce greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide or methane - and 1kg of nuclear fuel produces millions of times more energy than 1kg of coal.\\nBut like fossil fuels, nuclear fuels are non-renewable energy resources. \\nBuilding new nuclear plants of any size also creates emissions - for example, through manufacturing the large amounts of steel and other materials needed. \\nThe long-term environmental consequences of dealing with nuclear waste are also unclear. \\nCritics say government investments should focus on renewable power, such as wind turbines and solar panels, instead of new nuclear capacity.\\nNuclear power plants are extremely expensive to build, which is part of the reason the government is backing Rolls-Royce's cheaper design.\\nEach SMR is estimated to cost about \\u00c2\\u00a32bn, compared to a large-scale plant like Hinkley Point C, which could cost \\u00c2\\u00a323bn, although smaller reactors would also generate significantly less power. \\nThe government also hopes a new financial funding model could cut the cost of new nuclear projects. \\nBut it means electricity customers may have to pay part of schemes' costs upfront through their energy bills. \\nThere is also the price we will pay for the energy coming from the UK's new nuclear plants.\\nThe government agreed in 2013 it would pay \\u00c2\\u00a392.50 per megawatt hour for the electricity produced by Hinkley Point, which would rise with inflation. Although this is considerably below current prices due to the energy crisis, critics have said it is too expensive - for example at the start of last year, wholesale electricity was selling for \\u00c2\\u00a353 per megawatt hour.\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59212992\"}"
